# Web-Design-Challenge
The purpose of this project is to analyze how weathe data changes as you get closer to the equater. To accomplish 
the analysis, we pulled data from OpenWeatherMap API to assemble a dataset for over 500 cities.
 
After assembling the dataset, I used Matplotlib to plot various aspects of the wether vs latitude.  Factors I looked at 
included: Cloudiness, Temperature, Humidity, and Wind Speed.  The site provides the source data and visualizations created
as part of the analysis, as well ast explanations and descriptions of any trends and correlations witnessed.
